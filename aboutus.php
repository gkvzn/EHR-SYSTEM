                Dr. EHR is an EHR system which lets doctors easily manage their patient reccords. It allows the doctors to create, read, edit and delete their patient records.  They no longer have the need to write paper records and the patients records are easily accessible to the doctors. The EHR system is more secured than paper records and also lets safe and secure transfer of the patient records with consent of the patient. Dr.EHR is accessible in all smart devices.
                DR.EHR system is created by students of Deggendorf Institute of Technology (ECRI)  B.sc Health informatics in 2022. This website is basic EHR CRUD system that will be later developed into a full pledged EHR system. The system will be extended to physicians, lab professionals and will support interoperability. We thank our professor Mr.Ge Mouzhi for guiding, teaching and assisting us in developing the Dr.EHR system.
